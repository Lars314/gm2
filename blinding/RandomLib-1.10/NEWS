The current version of the library is 1.10.

Changes between 1.10 (released 2014-11-22) and 1.9 versions:

  * Maintenance release:
    + tweaks to the cmake build support and the documentation;
    + strengthen the advice to use C++11.

Changes between 1.9 (released 2014-03-15) and 1.8 versions:

  * Many changes in cmake support:
    + minimum version of cmake needed increased to 2.8.4 (which was
      released in 2011-02);
    + allow building both shared and static libraries with -D
      RANDOMLIB_LIB_TYPE=BOTH;
    + both shared and static libraries (Release plus Debug) included in
      binary installer;
    + find_package uses COMPONENTS and RandomLib_USE_STATIC_LIBS to
      select the library to use;
    + find_package version checking allows nmake and Visual Studio
      generators to interoperate on Windows;
    + find_package (RandomLib ...) requires that RandomLib be
      capitalized correctly;
    + on Unix/Linux, don't include the version number in directory for
      the cmake configuration files;
    + defaults for RANDOMLIB_DOCUMENTATION is now OFF;
    + the configuration parameters PACKAGE_PATH and INSTALL_PATH are
      now deprecated (use CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX instead).

  * _d added to library name in Windows project files.

Changes between 1.8 (released 2013-10-08) and 1.7 versions:

  * Work around a problem with Visual Studio 9.

Changes between 1.7 (released 2013-09-27) and 1.6 versions:

  * Add UniformInteger, DiscreteNormal, and DiscreteNormalAlt.
  * cmake configuration changes:
    + use folders in Visual Studio to reduce clutter;
    + improving setting of runtime path for Unix-like OS;
    + install PDB files when compiling with Visual Studio to aid
      debugging.
  * Eliminate link error in debug mode (in RandomMixer) and various
    warning messages.
  * Add macros RANDOMLIB_VERSION_{MAJOR,MINOR,PATCH} to Config.h.

Changes between 1.6 (released 2012-09-13) and 1.5 versions:

  * Documentation changes:
    + remove html documentation from distribution and use web links if
      doxygen is not available;
    + use doxygen tags to document exceptions;
    + use Greek letters where appropriate (requires doxygen 1.8.1.2 or
      later);
    + use MathJax to display equations.

  * Support building with cygwin and mingw32-g++ on Windows (via
    cmake).

  * Releases via git now use the "release" branch of the main
    randomlib repository (instead of a separate randomlib-release
    repository).

Changes between 1.5 (released 2012-03-20) and 1.4 versions:

  * cmake tweaks:
    + improve find_package's matching of compiler versions;
    + CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX set from CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH if available;
    + fix cmake warning with Visual Studio Express.

  * Fix for compilation with Visual Studio 11.

Changes between 1.4 (released 2012-02-21) and 1.3 versions:

  * Add MPFR interface.

  * Add InversePiProb and InverseEProb.

  * Change RandomNumber to a signed-magnitude representation; this
    results in slight incompatibilities in the interface.

  * A tweak to ExactNormal to minimize the number of digits generated.

  * Improve efficiency of ExactExponential.

  * Improve documentation on configuration with cmake.

  * cmake's find_package ensures that the compiler versions match on
    Windows.

Changes between 1.3 (released 2012-01-21) and 1.2 versions:

  * Improve algorithm used by RandomLib::ExactNormal class.

  * Add internal documenation to the cmake configuration files.

Changes between 1.2 (released 2011-12-20) and 1.1 versions:

  * Change license to MIT/X11.

  * Add RandomLib::ExactNormal class.  This enables you to sample
    exactly from a normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance
    (assuming that the underlying generator is perfect).

  * Document function arguments and return values.

  * Include OpenMP header in RandomThread.cpp.

Change between 1.1 (released 2011-09-21) and 1.0 versions:

  * Ensure that randomlib-config.cmake is relocatable.

Changes between 1.0 (released 2011-08-12) and 2011-06 versions:

  * cmake changes:
    + include FindRandom.cmake in distribution;
    + building with cmake creates and installs randomlib-config.cmake;
    + better support for building a shared library under Windows.

Changes between 2011-06 (released 2011-06-04) and 2010-05 versions:

  * Convert parallelization example, RandomThread.cpp, to OpenMP.

  * Migrate source from subversion to git.

Changes between 2011-05 (released 2011-05-17) and 2010-04 versions:

  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the default constructor Random r; sets the seed
    to [].  Use r.Reseed(); to reset the seed to Random::SeedVector();

  * Make sure Global generators are exported to the dll.

Changes between 2011-04 (released 2011-04-12) and 2010-01 versions:

  * Use cmake for configuration.

  * Improve documentation on installation process.

  * Improve documentation of parallelization.

  * Remove examples RandomPermutation and shuffle and add
    RandomCoverage, RandomExact, RandomLambda, RandomSave, and
    RandomThread

  * Add specialized swap

  * Ensure the code works with compilers with no long double type.

  * Add new and delete operators for SFMT19937 under Visual Studio.

Changes between 2010-01 and 2009-02 versions:

  * Move to SourceForge.

Changes between 2009-02 and 2008-11 versions:

  * RandomPermutation and shuffle accept -r option to undo a permutation
    or shuffle.

  * Minor documentation fixes.

Changes between 2008-11 and 2008-04 versions:

  * Changes to suppress warnings with g++ 4.3.

  * Optional support for C++11's static_assert.

  * Document RandomPermutation and shuffle.

  * Minor documentation fixes.

Changes between 2008-04 and 2008-01 versions:

  * Reorganized so random algorithm and mixer can be selected
    independently.  This eliminated a lot of duplicate code.

  * This requires a new, incompatible, output format.  Format is now
    independent of the current base of the stream.

  * Name() now returns more informative name.

  * SFMT19937 init_by_array mixer adopted for MT19937 generators.  This
    is an incompatible change for the MT19937 generators.  However it is
    possible to hook the MT19937 engine with the MixerMT1 mixers to
    recover the previous functionality using
    + RandomEngine<MT19937<Random_u32>, MixerMT1<Random_u32> >
    + RandomEngine<MT19937<Random_u64>, MixerMT1<Random_u64> >

  * The way 32-bit results are glued together for to provide the
    Ran64() result is now LSB ordered.  Previously the 32-bit version
    of MT19937 used MSB ordering here.  This means that certain large
    integer results will be different for
    RandomEngine<MT19937<Random_u32>, MixerMT1<Random_u32> >

  * Support Altivec instructions on PowerPC for SFTM19937.  Also use
    longer long double on PowerPC.

  * Add -s seed option to shuffle and RandomPermutation.

  * Use strtoull (where available) instead of strtoul in convert a
    string seed to numeric form.

  * Switch project files to MS Visual Studio 2005.

  * Use SeedVector() instead of SeedWord() for the default constructor
    for Random.

  * Make 32-bit version of SFMT19937 the default generator.

Changes between 2008-01 and 2007-05 versions:

  * This is a maintenance release in anticipation of a forthcoming major
    restructuring of the code.

  * Use table of powers of two for g++ 4.1.

  * Minor documentation fixes.

Changes between 2007-05 and 2007-04 versions:

  * Add SFMT19937 generators.

  * Introduce RandomGenerator::Name() to identify generator.

  * Change define used to make 64-bit generator the default.

  * Add RandomSelect::Weight.

  * Ensure portability to systems where RandomSeed::u32 is longer than 32
    bits.

Changes between 2007-04 and 2006-12 versions:

  * Add utilities RandomPermutation and shuffle.

  * Implement MSB ordering on binary I/O in a portable way.

Changes between 2006-12 and 2006-11 versions:

  * Add leapfrogging.  The output format needed to be changed to
    accommodate an extra word of data.  However, I/O routines can still
    read the 2006-11 version.

Changes between 2006-11 and 2006-10 versions:

  * Introduce RandomCanonical class which accepts the random generator
    as a template argument.

  * This allows the inclusion of 32-bit and 64-bit versions of mt19937.

  * Include checksum in I/O.

  * Include boost serialization.

Changes between 2006-10 and 2006-09 versions:

  * Make 64-bit ready so a 64-bit version of mt19937 can be dropped in.

  * Fix a bug in the seeding.  (This bug was trigged by seed length of
    624 or greater; so it was unlikely to have been encountered in
    practice.)

  * Stop the special case treatment for
    Random::IntegerC<T>(numeric_limits<T>::max()).  In some cases (e.g.,
    T = int) this now gives different (but equivalent) results.

Changes between 2006-09 and 2006-08 versions:

  * Add ExponentialProb, ExactExponential, ExactPower, and RandomNumber.

  * Fix weakness in the seeding algorithm.  A given seed now gives a
    random sequence different from previous version; so this is an
    incompatible change.

  * Restructure the documentation.

  * Allow constructors to accept vectors of any integral type and
    constructors with a pair of iterators.

Change between 2006-08 and 2006-07 versions:

  * Improve efficiency of Integer(n) where n is a power of two.
